# Code Away

**Code your way through this magical world!**
## Concept

Code Away is a puzzle game that meant to teach children how to handle hazardous objects without causing a fire, all while solving puzzles and keeping things playful and funny.

A child steps into a room and has to find all objects that might cause a fire. As the child progresses through the game, the objects become less and less immediate and the child has to search for clues that would help him find the objects (similar to escape room games).

## Formal Elements

### 1. Players

* The game's main audience are children, 6-15 years, old that can use a computer. The level of talent or experience necessary to play the game is minimal, which makes onboarding relatively easy.

* The game could be played in both single player mode, and two player mode. 

* The single player mode would be played against the clock while the two player mode could be played as a collaboration against the clock, or as a competition.

### 2. Goals

* When the time is up for each level, electrical power will go through the room's outlets and the fire stove, oven, or any other appliance would turn on. The players need to reach the end of the level with minimum objects left as hazardous in their room.

* The first levels of the game would serve as a tutorial where the player would be asked to fail and see the results of leaving the room uncleared. After seeing the damages, the player would be asked to fix the situation that caused the fire. 

* In two player mode, the players could choose to sabotage the room of the other player, though it is not taught in the tutorials and the players are left to find that out on their own.

### 3. Processes

* The first level should be extremely concise. It should take no more than 15 seconds to complete and figure the game out. A hazardous object in the room would be pointed at by an arrow and the player would have to fix the situation. In the same room, there would be another hazardous object and the player will not be instructed to move it. When the time is up for that level, the hidden object would catch fire and at that point, the player would understand the meaning of losing the game.

* Players would have to solve the puzzle of each level and move the correct objects in order to proceed to the next level. Solving puzzles will be constructed of finding keys, moving hidden objects and flipping switches. Players will use their keyboard to control the character on the screen.

* Every level will be time constrained and will end with electrical power coming through wall outlets and appliances turning on. New levels could always be added and in later version the game's community could create their own puzzles.

* The game will end when the player finishes all the available puzzles.

### 4. Rules

* The player can move any moveable object, even if it seems it will not help them solve the puzzle. 

* In single player mode, the player cannot leave the room. In two player mode, the player cannot leave the area in which the two rooms are present.

* The player scores points at the end of the level, based on the amount of damage caused to the room. The less, the better. A 0-3 star system would be put in place.

* Rules of the game would be made clear in the tutorial level. 


### 5. Resources

* The player could make use of every object in the room. Everything, apart from the walls, can be moved and used.

* The player can climb stools to reach a higher shelves, flip switches to power off an appliance, move objects from hazardous positions etc.

* The player can use hint points to get hints that would aid him in solving the current puzzle.

* For every level completed with 3 stars, the player will get coins that can be later used to buy hint points. Hint points will be hard to achieve because the player has to solve the puzzle with 3 stars. 

* The amount of coins and hint points can be displayed in the corner of the screen.

### 6. Conflict

* Time is your main adversary in the game. Players should be quick on their feet and creative. 
* In two player mode, every player has to out-score the other player. 


### 7. Boundaries


The room's walls would serve as the main boundaries of the game. 
A wall is a clear and well known boundary and every child will be able to figure it out.


### 8. Results

* Every level would have 4 available outcomes, represented by the 0-3 stars a player can achieve. 

* The outcome is solely dependent on skills. 
* In both single and two player mode, the game would have complex result. The player will be ranked 0-3 stars according to their performance.

## Market Research

Most similar games are:

1. Fire Escape!
    * [Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhbXFbKa3Jo)
    
    * Fire escape assumes a fire already started and the player only needs to escape. In our game the player needs to stop the fire from ever taking place.  

2. Oneiros
    * [Gameplay] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn4pvzGuCJQ)

    *Oneiros is a first person escape room taking place in a movie theatre, but things get out of hand and become interesting very quickly. The game encourages the player to inspect everything. It is similar to our game in that every object can be interacted with, whether it is useful or not. 

    Our game would be different because it is time constrained and is not for the same audience. 

3. The Room
    * [Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRwzDphvhV4&list=PL5dr1EHvfwpP7DB1cqtuSk0r9kl9VhGF1)

    * The room is also a first person escape room game, but it takes place in ancient times.

    * The game is much bigger than what we got planned, hence, it is much slower and much more elaborate.

    * Our game would be much quicker and more agile. The result of each level would not be fixed and it would not be a zero sum game like 'The Room'.
